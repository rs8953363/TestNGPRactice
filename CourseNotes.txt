////If there are two class names then you cannot use className as a locator. You need to use cssSelector.

//Diff btw xpath and cssSelector: With XPath, we can traverse both forward and backward, whereas a CSS selector only moves forward.
// Xpath allows bidirectional flow which means the traversal can be both ways from parent to child and child to parent as well.
// Css allows only one directional flow which means the traversal is from parent to child only.
// Xpath is slower in terms of performance and speed. Css has better performance and speed than xpath.

/*Absolute Xpath: It contains the complete path from the Root Element to the desire element. Relative Xpath: This is more
like starting simply by referencing the element you want and go from the particular location. You use always the
Relative Path for testing of an element.

Page Object Model, also known as POM, is a design pattern in Selenium that creates an object repository for storing all
web elements. It is useful in reducing code duplication and improves test case maintenance.
In Page Object Model, consider each web page of an application as a class file. Each class file will contain only
corresponding web page elements. Using these elements, testers can perform operations on the website under test.

Page Factory is a class provided by Selenium WebDriver to support Page Object Design patterns. In Page Factory, testers
use @FindBy annotation. The initElements method is used to initialize web elements.
@FindBy: An annotation used in Page Factory to locate and declare web elements using different locators.

https://w3schools.com Locators for a web table
Access to headings: //table/thead/tr/th  or   //table/tbody/tr/th   or  //table//th
Access to all lines in the table: //table/tbody/tr
Access to all cells in the table: //table/tbody/td
5th Cells in a row: (//table/tbody/tr)[5]
Only a specific column (//table)[1]//tr/td[3]
5th row and 2nd column
(//table)[1]//tr[5]/td[2]

"/" helps you to search only child elements
"// helps you to search both child elements and grandchildren elements
